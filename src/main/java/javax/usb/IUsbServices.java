  /**
   * Get the virtual IUsbHub to which all physical Host Controller IUsbHubs are
   * attached.
   * <p>
   * The USB root hub is a special hub at the top of the topology tree. The USB
   * 1.1 specification mentions root hubs in sec 5.2.3, where it states that
   * 'the host includes an embedded hub called the root hub'. The implication of
   * this seems to be that the (hardware) Host Controller device is the root
   * hub, since the Host Controller device 'emulates' a USB hub, and in systems
   * with only one physical Host Controller device, its emulated hub is in
   * effect the root hub. However when multiple Host Controller devices are
   * considered, there are two (2) options that were considered:
   * <ol>
   * <li>Have an array or list of the available topology trees, with each
   * physical Host Controller's emulated root hub as the root IUsbHub of that
   * particular topology tree. This configuration could be compared to the
   * MS-DOS/Windows decision to assign drive letters to different physical
   * drives (partitions).
   * </li>
   * <li>Have a 'virtual' root hub, which is completely virtual (not associated
   * with any physical device) and is created and managed solely by the
   * javax.usb implementation. This configuration could be compared to the UNIX
   * descision to put all physical drives on 'mount points' under a single
   * 'root' (/) directory filesystem.
   * </li>
   * </ol>
   * <p>
   * The first configuration results in having to maintain a list of different
   * and completely unconnected device topologies. This means a search for a
   * particular device must be performed on all the device topologies. Since a
   * IUsbHub already has a list of UsbDevices, and a IUsbHub <i>is</i> a
   * UsbDevice, introducing a new, different list is not a desirable action,
   * since it introduces extra unnecessary steps in performing actions, like
   * searching.
   * <p>
   * As an example, a recursive search for a certain device in the first
   * configuration involves getting the first root IUsbHub, getting all its
   * attached UsbDevices, and checking each device; any of those devices which
   * are IUsbHubs can be also searched recursively. Then, the entire operation
   * must be performed on the next root IUsbHub, and this is repeated for all
   * the root IUsbHubs in the array/list. In the second configuration, the
   * virtual root IUsbHub is recursively searched in a single operation.
   * <p>
   * The second configuration is what is used in this API. The implementation is
   * responsible for creating a single root IUsbHub which is completely virtual
   * (and available through the IUsbServices object). Every IUsbHub attached to
   * this virtual root IUsbHub corresponds to a physical Host Controller's
   * emulated hub. I.e., the first level of UsbDevices under the virtual root
   * IUsbHub are all IUsbHubs corresponding to a particular Host Controller on
   * the system. Note that since the root IUsbHub is a virtual hub, the number
   * of ports is not posible to specify; so all that is guaranteed is the number
   * of ports is at least equal to the number of IUsbHubs attached to the root
   * IUsbHub. The number of ports on the virtual root IUsbHub may change if
   * IUsbHubs are attached or detached (e.g., if a Host Controller is physically
   * hot-removed from the system or hot-plugged, or if its driver is dynamically
   * loaded, or for any other reason a top-level Host Controller's hub is
   * attached/detached). This API specification suggests that the number of
   * ports for the root IUsbHub equal the number of directly attached IUsbHubs.
   *
   * @return The virtual IUsbHub object.
   * @exception UsbException      If there is an error accessing javax.usb.
   * @exception SecurityException If current client not configured to access
   *                              javax.usb.
