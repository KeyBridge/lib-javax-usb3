/**
 * Standard Device Descriptor Types available when using the GET_DESCRIPTOR
 * standard device request.
 * <p>
 * All USB devices must response to a standard device request (USB 3.1 sec 9.4).
 * Device request {@code GET_DESCRIPTOR} returns {@link IUsbDescriptor} instance
 * for the particular device and request type.
 * <p>
 * The actual request value field specifies the descriptor type in the high byte
 * (refer to USB 2.0 Table 9-5; USB 3.1 Table 9-6 Descriptor Types) and the
 * descriptor index in the low byte.
 * <p>
 * Devices report their attributes using descriptors. A descriptor is a data
 * structure with a defined format. Each descriptor begins with a byte-wide
 * field that contains the total number of bytes in the descriptor followed by a
 * byte-wide field that identifies the descriptor type.
 * <p>
 * Using descriptors allows concise storage of the attributes of individual
 * configurations because each configuration may reuse descriptors or portions
 * of descriptors from other configurations that have the same characteristics.
 * In this manner, the descriptors resemble individual data records in a
 * relational database.
 * <p>
 * Where appropriate, descriptors contain references to string descriptors that
 * provide displayable information describing a descriptor in human-readable
 * form. The inclusion of string descriptors is optional. However, the reference
 * fields within descriptors are mandatory. If a device does not support string
 * descriptors, string reference fields shall be reset to zero to indicate no
 * string descriptor is available.
 * <p>
 * If a descriptor returns with a value in its length field that is less than
 * defined by this specification, the descriptor is invalid and should be
 * rejected by the host. If the descriptor returns with a value in its length
 * field that is greater than defined by this specification, the extra bytes are
 * ignored by the host, but the next descriptor is located using the length
 * returned rather than the length expected.
 * <p>
 * See USB 3.1 Table 9-6. Descriptor Types.
